            Win Efficiency is the ratio of wins in the 2019-20 season to the expected output as per NBA 2K; e.g. the Raptors have a great win efficiency because a lot of their minutes have been played by guys with low 2K ratings and yet they have a lot of wins.<br />
         = wins / SUM_ALL_PLAYERS(2019_20_minutes x scaled_2k_rating)
        </li>
        <li>
            To determine a player's value their rating isn't just added. Every player's value is raised to the power of 8 so that 2 players of ratings 75 and 100 create the same amount of value when player of 75 plays 10x the minutes of the player of 100. Yeah it's not perfect...
