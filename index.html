    Win Efficiency is the ratio of wins in the 2019-20 season to the expected output as per NBA 2K; e.g. the timberwolve have quite a good win efficiency because a lot of their minutes have been played by guys with low 2K ratings and yet they have a lot of wins.<br />
     = wins / SUM_ALL_PLAYERS(2019_20_minutes x scaled_2k_rating)
